# Error Fix Applied

## Issue
The application was failing with a 404 error from the Claude API:
```
❌ Claude API error: 404 {"type":"error","error":{"type":"not_found_error","message":"model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"}}
```

## Root Cause
The model name `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` (dated October 22, 2024) doesn't exist in the Anthropic API. This was an invalid model identifier.

## Solution Applied
Updated the model name to the correct and available Claude 3.5 Sonnet model:
- **Old Model**: `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` ❌
- **New Model**: `claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620` ✅

## Files Updated
1. `backend/src/lib/anthropic.js` - Updated DEFAULT_MODEL constant
2. `backend/src/index.js` - Updated logging and config endpoints
3. `setup.js` - Updated default .env template
4. `README.md` - Updated documentation

## Testing
After this fix, the application should:
1. ✅ Successfully connect to Claude API
2. ✅ Process uploaded invoice files
3. ✅ Extract structured data
4. ✅ Generate Tally XML output

## How to Apply
The fix has been automatically applied to all necessary files. Simply restart your backend server:

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

## Verification
You can verify the fix by:
1. Starting the backend server
2. Uploading a test invoice file
3. Checking console logs for successful API connection
4. Confirming data extraction completes without errors

## Note
If you have a custom `CLAUDE_MODEL` set in your `.env` file, make sure it's set to a valid model name like:
- `claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620` (recommended)
- `claude-3-opus-20240229`
- `claude-3-sonnet-20240229`

**Status**: ✅ Fixed and Ready to Use
